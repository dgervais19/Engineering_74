Good Afternoon, my name is Donovan and I have recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I come from a musical and technical family who used to take me to musical events and computer fairs as a child. In music i achieved grade 8 in piano, and i believe that my musical background has helped me develop the analytical mind that i have now.

In university i studied computer science as a whole therefore i learned about a wide range of computing skills including database concepts, web scripting, software development and more. For my final year project i created a bespoke invoicing system for small businesses using html, PHP, and phpMyAdmin.
