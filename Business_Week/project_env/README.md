* Business as usual is basic day-to-day operations and structure that keep the company running (routine). It is ongoing.
	- The general principles of the business that are followed, e.g. Starting at 9am and finishing at 5pm.

	- e.g. all ongoing projects or events in the organisation eg. Python DevOps.


## Project Cycle

1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing

**NOTE: projects require a balance of these three contraints depending on the needs of the customer**

## Software Development Lifecycles:

* Waterfall:
	- System Requirements
	- Software Requirements
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Coding
	- Testing 
	- Maintenance

It also includes requirement gathering



## ROI

ROI stands for Return of Investment. Refers to the worth of the product and talks about terms like cashflow and payback etc.
