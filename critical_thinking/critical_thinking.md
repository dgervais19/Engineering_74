# Critical Thinking

## Why is Critical Thinking Important?

  * It helps you provide strong arguments with the evidence that you hace evaluated.
  * We want to find the truth rather than being right.

## Benjamin Bloom's Thinking Triangle Shows us How to Apply Critical Thinking Skills

## Three Steps in Critical Thinking

 ### Identify:

    * We need to identify the main points of the argument.
    * Identify the claims that are made
    * See what evidence is being used
    * What are the conclusions reached

 ### Analyse:

    * Does the information make sense in relation to other research?
    * How old is the material?
    * Does the argument present a balanced view

 ### Apply:
  
    * What are the implications of other information?
    * What are the weaknesses when applied to a real life situation?
    * Is there a lack of coverage?



 ## Three Modes of Thinking

  ### Divergent
     
     * Imagination - question -> idea etc. (think about the film series 'Divergent' and what it is about


  ### Convergent

     * Logic - fact -> answer etc.


  ### Lateral

     * Combination of both


## Incorrect Attitudes

  * Arguing for the sake of it.
  * Wanting to prove the other person wrong so much that you disregard they point completely.


## Enquiry Based Learning

  * It's the concept of learning by asking questions and not jumping to conclusions.


### What Type of Questions might we ask?

  Make sure your first few questions help ease into the conversation.

  * What is the source of evidence?
  * What claims are being made?
  * What are the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence?
  * Is the argument a balanced one?
  * Do we understand the context?

DO NOT ASSUME!!



## Basica Argument Structure

 * Claim - Clearly present your argument
 * Evidence - Make sure you back up your claim with evidence
 * Impact - What is the significance of this evidence?


## Logical Fallacies

 * False dichotomy - When the speaker forces a debate into two sides (devils advocate)
 * Straw man
 * Contradiction
